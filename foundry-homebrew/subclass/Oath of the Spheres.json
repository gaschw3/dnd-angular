				"The Oath of Spheres is sometimes taken by warriors who serve otherworldly entities and quest to release them into the material plane, but other adherents are incidental devotees. Some were trying to prevent otherworldly incursion and lost their way. Some simply allowed their studies or imagination to roam too widely. Whatever the cause, many who find themselves brushing too close to incomprehensible truth eventually take this oath and become singly devoted to showing others the joy of unrestrained consciousness found in the ever-widening gyre of the stars.",
