				"Those who take the Oath of Revelry value pleasure and beauty above all else. Such paladins are often avid hedonists, believing personal pleasure and satisfaction to be the most moral path. Those who have chosen this path are the center of attention and bring pleasure and celebration to the masses. They often travel the world to experience everything life has to offer - usually trying to entice other to pursue luxuries with enchantments, illusion, or good old-fashioned charm.",
        "Not all such paladins are bon vivants, however; some serve darker agendas. Making a pact with a dark deity is not unheard of, especially in pursuit of one's own perfection. They use their powers to corrupt others by twisting desires and skill empowerments into acts of violence and self-destruction.",
				"Regardless of their intentions, the Oath of Revelry leads creatures to experience as much in life as possible; destroying your enemies should bring as much elation as the celebrations of your victories.",
